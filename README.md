# üåç WorldGuessr Cheat

This is a small Python script using [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) to intercept and extract coordinates from Google Maps image search requests.

Whenever a matching request is detected, it automatically opens the exact location in Google Maps but zoomed out so you can see the general area (like country level).

## üöÄ What It Does

- Listens for specific internal Google Maps API requests.
- Parses the request data to extract latitude and longitude.
- Opens the coordinates in your default browser on Google Maps.
